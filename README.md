This Quarto book is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the FP&A DS Team. If we missed anything, please let Christian Lopes (Christian.Lopes@vrad.com) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!
