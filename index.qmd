# Welcome!

Welcome to our book of magical secrets.

<br> This is the team manual for the Financial Planning and Analysis Data Science team at vRad.\
The focus of our work centers around developing interdisciplinary modeling approaches to identify, optimize, facilitate actions to increase business value. 

This team manual resource is intended to provide an overview for team members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Christian (christian.lopes@vrad.com) or make a pull request.

The content for this book was developed as part of Christian's participation in the [Openscapes Champions program](https://openscapes.org).\
